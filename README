Homework 2 - Proxy Server
Class: 4510 Computer Networks
Date: 4/26/2016
Files: proxyServer.cpp, Makefile, README

Command Lines:
./proxy <port>
telnet localhost <port> 
Trying 127.0.0.1... 
Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1). 
Escape character is '^]'. 
GET http://www.cnn.com/ HTTP/1.0 

Description:
This program operates as a HTTP proxy server.
It handles conncurrent requests via a thread pool of 30 threads
and uses a lock to prevent race conditions. 
upon making a connection with the client, it reads the request.
This request is stored in a char array of size 2048. 
This request is then validated as it is parsed. If a request is 
invalid (not in absolute URI Form), the parsing function will 
return a invalid port of -1 and alter the output message to a
500 error. If a request is valid, then the function will return 
the port number and the reformated message (relative URL).
If the port is -1, then the error is sent to the client.
If the port is valid, then the reformated request is sent to the
remote server. The response recieved from the server is then sent
to the client.
