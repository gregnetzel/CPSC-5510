GET http://www.cnn.com/ HTTP/1.0 

Description:
This program operates as a HTTP proxy server.
upon making a connection with the client, it reads the request. 
This request is then validated. If a request is invalid 
not in absolute URI Form), the ValidRequest function will 
return false which triggers a 500 error message to the client
If a request is valid, then the host and reformated message 
(relative URL) will be found and used to contact the server. 
The response recieved from the server is then sent to the client.
